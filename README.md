# README for NLP Disaster Tweet Classification with RoBERTa

This project focuses on classifying disaster-related tweets using a fine-tuned RoBERTa model. It leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library for efficient implementation.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- **Data:** Utilizes the "nlp-getting-started" dataset from Kaggle, containing tweets labeled as disaster-related or not.
- **Tokenization:** Employs the RoBERTa tokenizer from Hugging Face to convert text into numerical representations suitable for the model.
- **Dataset Preparation:** Creates PyTorch TensorDataset objects for efficient training and evaluation.

### 2. Model Selection and Fine-tuning
- **Model:** Utilizes the pre-trained RoBERTa model from Hugging Face, specifically designed for natural language understanding tasks.
- **Fine-tuning:** Adapts the RoBERTa model for the specific task of disaster tweet classification.
- **Optimization:** Employs the AdamW optimizer for efficient training.

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- **Training Loop:** Implements a training loop to fine-tune the RoBERTa model on the disaster tweet dataset.
- **Evaluation Metric:** Uses the F1 score as the primary evaluation metric to assess model performance.
- **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverages GPU acceleration (if available) for faster training and inference.

### 4. Prediction and Submission
- **Inference:** Generates predictions on the test dataset using the fine-tuned RoBERTa model.
- **Submission:** Formats the predictions according to Kaggle's submission guidelines.
